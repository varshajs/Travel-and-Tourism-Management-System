# Travel-and-Tourism-Management-System
Our project is a Travel and Tourism Management System designed to streamline the process of booking travel packages, hotels, and transport in a single platform. The idea is similar to real-world platforms like MakeMyTrip or Yatra, where users can view available packages, book them, and make payments, while administrators can manage packages and related services. We built this as a full-stack web application with a strong database backend to ensure data consistency, automation, and role-based access.
Technology Stack

Backend / Application Layer: Python Flask framework (for web routes, authentication, sessions).

Database: MySQL (for storing users, roles, packages, hotels, bookings, payments).

DB Connector: Pythonâ€™s mysql-connector to interact with MySQL.

Frontend: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap for styling.
